## Introduction

NISN (National International Space Network) is a mobile application built using the Flutter framework. Its main goal is to provide a platform for Amateur Radio Operators to submit and visualize data related to space activities. The app serves as a hub for enthusiasts to share their observations and contribute to the global space community.

## Features

- User-friendly data submission forms for Amateur Radio Operators.
- Interactive visualizations of submitted data, allowing users to explore trends and patterns.
- Real-time updates and notifications for new data submissions.
- Secure authentication and user profiles for personalized experiences.

## Acknowledgments

We would like to express our gratitude to NASA and the Space Apps Challenge organizers for providing the inspiration and opportunity to work on this project. Special thanks to our mentors, supporters, and the entire Amateur Radio Operators community for their contributions and feedback.

## Apology

We would like to apologize for the current state of the codebase. As of the last update, the code is not null safe, and we acknowledge that updating it to be null safe would be beneficial for the project's stability and long-term maintenance. We understand the importance of null safety in modern Flutter development. While we are aware of this issue, due to various constraints and time limitations, we have not yet been able to fully migrate the codebase to null safety. We appreciate your understanding and patience as we work towards improving the codebase in the future.
